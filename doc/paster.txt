About                                       |paster-about|

Paste text from the current document onto a public pastebin or board.  This 
implementation is written in vim to reduce external depencencies to Python or
Perl.  The only external dependency is cURL (e.g. /usr/bin/curl in UNIX-like
systems) as an HTTP posting tool.  This posting tool, and all its command line
parameters are configurable by the user.

FEATURES                                                     *paster-features*

* Pastes to any pastebin with a public API
* The end-user's nick is configurable per use, or via .vimrc
* Sends syntax highlighting information if the target supports it
* Uses standard vim range commands for its use
* Copies the URL where the text was pasted to the system clipboard and the
  status line

USAGE                                                           *paster-usage*

Install paster.vim to the appropriate default vim scripts directory for your
configuration, normally $HOME/.vim/plugin 

Once installed, the Paste[bin] command may be invoked in any of these patterns:

- :.Paste -- paste the current line
- :%Paste -- paste the entire document
- :42,69Paste -- paste lines 42 through 69, inclusive

The Paste command will work with selections made in visual mode as well.

Paste will prompt for a value if the user hasn't defined a /nick or ID prior
to the command's first invocation. 

Upon successful completion, Paste will display the URL to the paste.  Under
gvim, Paste will also copy it to the window manager's clipboard.

REQUIREMENTS                                             *paster-requirements*

The initial versions of paster.vim were coded and tested under OS X, Linux,
and Solaris.  As such, they all use /usr/bin/curl for posting data to the
pastebin.  Any reasonably recent version of cURL is acceptable, and vim
6.2 or later.


==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                           *paster-configuration*

The script relies on several pastebin- and environment-dependent symbolic
constants that the user may override to customize the target pastebin or
the tool used for posting the text to it.  As long as cURL is installed,
the Paste[bin] function should work without ever having to touch any of
the configuration parameters.

These should be set as global variables in your vimrc:  

    let g:PASTE_COMMAND = "curl"

etc. 

CONSTANT              DEFAULT VALUE              DESCRIPTION

                                                 highlighting text.

                                                 by the value input for /nick
                                                 or ID when prompted, or by
                                                 the value of g:nickID.
